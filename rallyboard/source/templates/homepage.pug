    Add scoring data is gathered from Rally America's website and there are 
    no guarantees of accuracy.  Inspiration for this was taken from the 
    #[a(href="http://www.daronhume.com/rally/combine.php5?new_rally=1&rally_id=colo&rally_year=2017") Rally America Combiner Thing].  
    This site caches times in it's own database to provide you fast
    page loads and to reduce the load on RA's site.
